Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

For my final project I wanted my program to do a particular thing if certain
conditions had been met. The ability to right a function which returned True
if the conditions were met and False if not, was very useful in making my
code more reuseable and cleaner. Trying to write it without functions would
have been a nightmare especially when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

I think its value lies in the fact that it compels you to think of things
that could potentially break your code. Test functions also provide the 
luxury of testing particular functions without having to run the entire
code from start to finish.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The first thing I usually do is check that my IDE has not flagged any syntax
errors. Then, I write a test program. If I still am not able to find the 
problem, I use the debug functionality and go thrrough the steps and variables
the program is taking and saving.
