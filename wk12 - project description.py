"""
1.	I spent more than 3 hours on my program.
2.	My program is organized into multiple functions and each function performs a single task.
3.	This week I was able to complete the GUI look of my program using the tkinter module.
4.	Some of the functions in my program are: clear, open_file, next, get_date, populate_main_window. 
    In my test file I currently only have the functions: test_get_date and test_clear. In accomplishing what 
    I have so far, I read the python docs on tkinter, csv, and datetime. I tried using DictWriter to write the
    contents of a dictionary to a csv file and was partially successful, mostly because I am still trying to figure 
    out a way to write headers and have the program check for header and if a header is present, proceed to just append 
    data to the end of the file instead of creating a new header every time.
        As mentioned before, the GUI part of the program is done, except if I get more/better ideas down the line, then I 
    would add that. I have also been able to create a file and append to a file created with the current date in the file 
    name
